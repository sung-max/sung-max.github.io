### Academic

I'm an ex-grad student in Computer Science (currently on leave). 

In the past, I tried research in Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning.
More recently, I've been catching up on some pure math and physics I thought I should understand before I get too old.

### Personal

I grew up in a tropical island.
I did my undergrad and masters in the east coast US.

In my free time I usually train weights and listen to music from [90s][shes-so-high] and 00's.
I've grown to like many sports, particular team sports, in the past few years.
So far I've tried badminton, volleyball, soccer, frisbee, and basketball.
