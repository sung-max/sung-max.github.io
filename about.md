### Academic

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at MIT, recently back after a leave!\
Currently, I'm investigating fundamental issues and phenomena in Deep Learning.

In the past, I did some research in Theoretical Computer Science and Theoretical Machine Learning.\
I did my undergrad at Cornell University, which provided me a wonderful foundation in Computer Science.

### Personal

I also enjoy learning mathematics and physics, but I don't have much time nowadays.\
Please share if you have any advice on learning more efficiently..

On programming: Like many, I _like_ the idea of Haskell (how can one not find monads fascinating?).\
But--I usually code in Python, which is pretty great too.
