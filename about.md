### Academic

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at MIT, recently back after a leave!  
Currently, I'm investigating fundamental issues and phenomena in Deep Learning.

In the past, I did some research in Theoretical Computer Science and Theoretical Machine Learning.  
I did my undergrad at Cornell University, which provided me a wonderful foundation in Computer Science.

### Personal

I enjoy thinking about mathematics and physics, but I don't have much time nowadays.  
If you think you can explain renormalization well, let me know, as I'm still quite confused.

On programming: Like many, I _like_ the idea of Haskell (how can one not love monads?).  
But; I usually code in Python, which is pretty great too.
