I'm an ex-grad student in Computer Science (currently on leave). In the past, I tried research in Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning.
More recently, I've been catching up on some pure math and physics I thought I should know.

In my free time I like moving weights around and listening to music from [90's][she's-so-high] and 00's.
