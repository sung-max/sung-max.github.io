### Academic

I'm a grad student in Computer Science, currently on leave.
In the past, I tried research in Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning.

I also like learning mathematics and physics, but it's getting more and more difficult to keep up with all my interests..

Like many, I like the idea of Haskell, but I usually code in Python, which is pretty good.

### Personal

I grew up in Seoul and Singapore.
I did my undergrad at Cornell in the beautiful city of Ithaca.

In my free time I usually train weights and listen to music from [90s][shes-so-high] and 00's.
Though I was far from physically active in my younger years, I like to spend a good fraction of my time now playing sports. So far I've tried badminton, volleyball, soccer, frisbee, and basketball.
