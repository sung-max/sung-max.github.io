#### Academic

I'm an ex-grad student in Computer Science (currently on leave). 

In the past, I tried research in Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning.
More recently, I've been catching up on some pure math and physics I thought I should understand before I get too old.

#### Personal

I grew up in a tropical island hating the humidity, then got rewarded with 4pm sunsets and snowstorms in April in the east coast.

In my free time I usually move weights around and listen to music from [90s][she's-so-high] and 00's.
I've grown to like many sports, particular team sports, since going to grad school (kind of late to the game, but yolo).
So far I've tried badminton, volleyball, soccer, frisbee, and basketball.
