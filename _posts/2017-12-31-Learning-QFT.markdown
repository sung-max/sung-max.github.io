I spent the past five months getting familiar with the basics of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). 
I thought I might write a post to provide some guidance to someone who, like me, have always wanted to understand basics of QFT but have had somewhat
limited education in college level physics [1].



Here's a functional integral to start off:
$$\int \mathcal{D}[q]e^{i S[q]} $$

...\[to be continued\]

[1] To give some context for my background: I took AP Physics B & C in highschool and one undergraduate physics course on Classical Mechanics (Lagrangrians, Hamiltonians),
but that is as far as my education in physics has gone inside of class.
I've always *liked* physics though, and read numerous pop science books growing up.

Actually, I liked physics a lot at the end of highschool and there was some chance I double majored in it in college.
A combination of a few circumstances led me to not do so.
