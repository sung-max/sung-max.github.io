### Background 
I spent the past five months getting familiar with the basics of Quantum Field Theory (QFT).
I thought I might write a post to provide some guidance to someone who, like me, have always wanted to understand basics of QFT but have had somewhat
limited education in college level physics.

To give more context for my background: I took AP Physics B & C in highschool and one undergraduate physics course on [Classical Mechanics][phy3318], but that is as far as my education in physics has gone inside of class.
I've always *liked* physics though, and read numerous pop-science books growing up. I liked physics a lot in highschool and I considered double majoring in it in college, but it never happened for a number of reasons.
Being away from school (ironically?) has given me time to rebuild the some of the missing undergrad foundations and dive into some of the more advanced topics.

### Before QFT

QFT does have its prerequisites, but it is not as daunting as it may seem.




A mathematician's QFT is another beast it seems, and I have yet to learn that myself.


### Resources

Here are some books and articles that have helped me along the way.


Here's a functional integral to start off:
$$\int \mathcal{D}[q]e^{i S[q]} $$
