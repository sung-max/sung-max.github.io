This is it! This is my first [1] blog post.

I've been playing with the idea maybe since about a month ago [2].
I thought it would be a good medium to practice my technical writing [3], but also to write down my thoughts somewhere as I realize I forget things more easily now.

They say explaining to others is the best way to learn. Part of that is having an interested audience, and the internet can probably find them easily.

I hope to write about a wide range of technical topics of my interest: mathematics, physics, computer science, statistics, programming, and anything in the mix.

---------

For the blogging platform, I initially debated between [WordPress][word-press] and what I ended up with. So far, I'm happy that I'm able to directly write my posts in [Markdown][markdown] online on Github.

I spent a whole brainstorming for a [clever][in-theory] name, but failed to live up to my own standards. If I get an idea in the future, I'll update.

Getting to my first post took more hours than I had expected or wanted. Despite there being many tutorials out there no single one seemed to do it for me. Maybe it was my lack of experience with the web but I can't rid the feeling that I just hacked it together. Maybe I'll write a short post about the steps, but I doubt my tutorial (which is also paritcular to my own experience, given my particular development environment and so on) will help someone given how not quite satisfactory help I got from many similar tutorials out there already.

Nonetheless, they have streamlined the process so much now that if you are playing around with the idea of starting a blog and have a free day, you should just give it a go.

[1] Well, I had sort of a blog briefly in highschool that I made mostly to add to my resume for college apps, but nothing much came of it.

[2] I've been getting intermittent computer access the past year, and I'm currently on an unusually long vacation *with* unlimited computer access, so I thought I might push myself to do something productive on a computer.

[3] which I'll need to improve as I plan on going back to grad school
