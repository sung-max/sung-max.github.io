This is it! This is my first [1] blog.

I've been playing with the idea maybe since about a month ago [2].
I thought it would be a good medium to practice my technical writing [3], but also to write down my thoughts somewhere as I realize I forget things more easily now.

They say explaining to others is the best way to learn. Part of that is having an interested audience, and the internet can probably find them more easily. 

I hope to write about a wide range of technical topics of my interest: mathematics, physics, computer science, statistics, programming, and anything in the mix.


[1] Well, I had a website briefly in highschool around that I made mostly as a reference for college apps, but nothing much came of it. Also, someone mostly built the website for me.

[2] I've been getting intermittent computer access the past year, and I'm currently on an unusually long vacation *with* unlimited computer access, so I thought I might push myself to do something productive on a computer.

[3] which I'll need to improve as I plan on going back to grad school


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
